    "CPR": "To perform CPR, place the heel of one hand in the center of the person's chest, place your other hand on top, and interlock your fingers. Position your shoulders over your hands and with straight arms, push down on the chest about 2 inches with each compression. Perform 30 compressions, then tilt the person's head back and lift their chin to open their airway. Pinch their nose shut and give two rescue breaths by breathing into their mouth until you see their chest rise. Then give 30 more compressions and repeat the cycle of 2 rescue breaths and 30 compressions until emergency medical help arrives.",
    "Minor Cuts": "To spot bleeding, look for blood on the person's clothing or on the ground around them. If you see blood, approach the person and assess the severity of the bleeding. For minor cuts or scrapes, you can clean the wound with soap and water and apply a bandage. For more serious bleeding, apply firm pressure directly to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage. Elevate the affected area if possible and if the bleeding is severe, call emergency services right away. Signs of severe bleeding include blood spurting from the wound, a large amount of blood, or blood that does not stop flowing after several minutes of applying pressure. It is important to act quickly and seek medical attention for severe bleeding",
    "Minor Burns": "The first step in providing first aid for burns is to remove the source of the heat, such as fire or hot water. For minor burns, you should run cool water over the affected area for several minutes to reduce pain and swelling. Do not use ice as this can damage the skin. Cover the area with a sterile gauze or a clean, dry cloth to protect it from infection. For more severe burns, cover the affected area with a clean, dry cloth and seek medical attention. Do not apply any creams or ointments to the burn as this can trap heat and make the burn worse. It is also important to monitor the person's breathing, as burns can cause swelling in the airways that can make it difficult to breathe. If the person is having difficulty breathing or is unconscious, call emergency services right away. It is important to remember that burns can be serious and require prompt medical attention, so if in doubt, seek medical help immediately.",
    "Heat Stroke": "Heatstroke is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. If you suspect someone has heatstroke, move them to a cool, shaded area and call for emergency medical assistance. While waiting for help, remove any excess clothing and fan the person to promote air circulation and help cool them down. Apply cool water to their skin or immerse them in a cool bath if possible. Do not give them anything to drink, and do not give them aspirin or acetaminophen, as these can make the situation worse. Keep monitoring the person's temperature and vital signs until medical assistance arrives.",
    "Diabetes (Insulin)": "In a power outage when refrigerated insulin isn’t available. Try to keep your insulin as cool as possible, but make sure not to freeze it. Insulin that has been frozen can break down and will be less effective. Keep your insulin away from direct heat and out of direct sunlight, which also make it less effective. For up to 4 weeks, you can use insulin in opened or unopened vials that have been stored at room temperature (between 59°F and 86°F). Realistically, you may have to use insulin that has been stored above 86°F. If so, monitor your blood sugar regularly. If you’re living in an emergency shelter, let someone in charge know if your blood sugar is too high or low, so they can get help if needed. Contact the doctor as soon as the emergency is over.",
    "Asthma Attack": "Someone having an asthma attack will have difficulty breathing and speaking, and may cough and wheeze. They may be very anxious and distressed as they struggle to breathe. In some cases, their lips, earlobes and nail beds may turn greyish-blue because there isn’t enough oxygen in their body. Help the person sit in a comfortable position and take their inhaler. When someone has an asthma attack, their airways narrow, making it difficult for them to breathe. An inhaler relaxes the muscles, allowing the airways to expand and ease their breathing."
